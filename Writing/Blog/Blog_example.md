## Roadmap
- Start with learning basic tags of HTML like head, body, link, para, header, img, link etc..
- After these tags, we can start with CSS alongside some more HTML tags can be learned .
- Start working on your first website it can be a landing page/ static form/ portfolio website or anything with which you feel comfortable to start with.
- After getting familiar with HTML and CSS you can pick any one CSS framework and start exploring it. I would recommend starting with Bootstrap or Materialize as they are easy to use and also used by many industries.
- After getting familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascript you can start building static websites and it would help you tackle real world problem or aligning elements and positioning them and making a website responsive.

### Note:
As you will make more and more projects or work with people on different projects you will gain more experience and hence would be confidence enough to contribute to real world projects.

# #TechForRookies: What is React.js?

React.js is a front-end JavaScript framework developed by Facebook. To build composable user interfaces predictably and efficiently using declarative code, we use React. It’s an open-source and component-based framework responsible for creating the application’s view layer.  

- ReactJs follows the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture, and the view layer is accountable for handling mobile and web apps.
- React is famous for building single-page applications and mobile apps.

## Why Do People Choose To Program With React ?

There are various reasons why you should choose ReactJS as a primary tool for website UI development. Here, I highlighted the most notable ones and explain why these specifics are so important:

- Fast - Feel quick and responsive through the Apps made in React can handle complex updates.

- Modular - Allow you to write many smaller, reusable files instead of writing large, dense files of code. The modularity of React is an attractive solution for JavaScript's visibility issues.

- Scalable - React performs best in the case of large programs that display a lot of data changes.

- Flexible - React approaches differently by breaking them into components while building user interfaces. This is incredibly important in large applications.

- Popular - ReactJS gives better performance than other JavaScript languages due to it’s implementation of a virtual DOM.

- Easy to learn - Since it requires minimal understanding of HTML and JavaScript, the learning curve is low.

- Server-side rendering and SEO friendly - ReactJS websites are famous for their server-side rendering feature. It makes apps faster and much better for search engine ranking in comparison to products with client-side rendering. React even produces more opportunities for website SEO and can occupy higher positions on the search result’s page.

- Reusable UI components - React improves development and debugging processes.

- Community - The number of tools and extensions available for ReactJS developers is tremendous. Along with impressive out-of-box functionalities, more opportunities emerge once you discover how giant the React galaxy is. React has a vibrant community and is supported by Facebook. Hence, it’s a reliable tool for website development.



So, when you hear the term IDE being thrown around, think of it as a text editor for code, with a few bells and whistles (if you think spellcheck is good, just wait for the hints and flagging some IDE’s provide). Once you understand that, you’re talking tech!

## Reactjs Features: 

### JSX - JavaScript Syntax Extension
JSX is a preferable choice for many web developers. It isn't necessary to use JSX in React development, but there is a massive difference between writing react.js documents in JSX and JavaScript. JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. By using that, we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code.

### Unidirectional Data Flow and Flux

React.js is designed so that it will only support data that is flowing downstream, in one direction. If the data has to flow in another direction, you will need additional features.

React contains a set of immutable values passed to the component renderer as properties in HTML tags. The components cannot modify any properties directly but support a call back function to do modifications. 

### Virtual Document Object Model (VDOM)

React contains a lightweight representation of real DOM in the memory called Virtual DOM. Manipulating real DOM is much slower compared to VDOM as nothing gets drawn on the screen. When any object’s state changes, VDOM modifies only that object in real DOM instead of updating whole objects. 

That makes things move fast, particularly compared with other front-end technologies that have to update each object even if only a single object changes in the web application.

### Extensions

React supports various extensions for application architecture. It supports server-side rendering, Flux, and Redux extensively in web app development. React Native is a popular framework developed from React for creating cross-compatible mobile apps.

### Debugging

Testing React apps is easy due to large community support. Even Facebook provides a small browser extension that makes React debugging easier and faster.

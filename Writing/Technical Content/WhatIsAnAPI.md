**What is an API?**

APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. 
For example, the weather bureau’s software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system 
via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.

**What does API stand for?**

API stands for Application Programming Interface. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software with a distinct function.
Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using 
requests and responses. Their API documentation contains information on how developers are to structure those requests and responses.

**How do APIs work?**
API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server. The application sending the request is called the client, and the application 
sending the response is called the server. So in the weather example, the bureau’s weather database is the server, and the mobile app is the client.

**What are API integrations?**

API integrations are software components that automatically update data between clients and servers. Some examples of API integrations are when automatic 
data sync to the cloud from your phone image gallery, or the time and date automatically sync on your laptop when you travel to another time zone.
Enterprises can also use them to efficiently automate many system functions

**What is an API endpoint and why is it important?**

API endpoints are the final touchpoints in the API communication system. These include server URLs, services, and other specific digital locations from 
where information is sent and received between systems. API endpoints are critical to enterprises for two main reasons: 

1. Security
API endpoints make the system vulnerable to attack. API monitoring is crucial for preventing misuse.

2. Performance
API endpoints, especially high traffic ones, can cause bottlenecks and affect system performance.

**How to create an API?**

Due diligence and effort are required to build an API that other developers will want to work with and trust. These are the five steps required for
high-quality API design:

1. Plan the API 
API specifications, like OpenAPI, provide the blueprint for your API design. It is better to think about different use cases in advance and ensure the 
API adheres to current API development standards.

2. Build the API
 API designers prototype APIs using boilerplate code. Once the prototype is tested, developers can customize it to internal specifications.

3. Test the API  
API testing is the same as software testing and must be done to prevent bugs and defects. API testing tools can be used to strength test the API against
cyber attacks.

4. Document the API  
While APIs are self-explanatory, API documentation acts as a guide to improve usability. Well-documented APIs that offer a range of functions and use
cases tend to be more popular in a service-oriented architecture.

5. Market the API 
Just as Amazon is an online marketplace for retail, API marketplaces exist for developers to buy and sell other APIs. Listing your API can allow you to monetize it.

**What is API testing?**

API testing strategies are similar to other software testing methodologies. The main focus is on validating server responses. API testing includes:

Making multiple requests to API endpoints for performance testing.
Writing unit tests for checking business logic and functional correctness.
Security testing by simulating system attacks.

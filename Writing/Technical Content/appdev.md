**#APP_Dev**


When it comes to the IT industry, there are plenty of career paths to take. But one field that has seen a tremendous rise in popularity, of late, is that of mobile App Development. 

Mobile devices have become ubiquitous—two-thirds of the world’s population is connected with a mobile device. That’s more than 5 billion unique mobile subscribers. This means that using mobile apps for everything from shopping to getting a ride, scheduling appointments, design, playing video games, and more—all on a mobile device—has become commonplace.





As a result, the need for mobile app developers has surged, and will likely remain upwardly mobile for a long time to come. The blossoming startup scene has also contributed a large chunk of the demand for mobile app developers, and many of these startups are prepared to pay very competitive salaries to deserving candidates. Many startups are already switching to only mobile and no web environments; in a sense, the revolution in computing devices witnessed two decades ago is now being played out on the mobile front.



**Why Get Involved in Mobile App Development?**

The allure of designing something new and fresh.
The opportunity to be able to reinvent the way mobile technology is used.
App developers can work anywhere – all they need is access to a strong internet connection and a good SDK.
**Steps to Becoming a Mobile App Developer**

To learn how to become a mobile app developer, first you should learn popular programming languages as C, C++, C#, and Java. The specific choice of language naturally depends on what mobile platform and OS it is they are creating the apps for. For example, apps for Apple’s iOS most often use Objective C, whereas Java is the language to acquire proficiency in for Android apps.




Most employers these days look for mobile apps developers with at least a bachelor’s degree in one of the following disciplines:

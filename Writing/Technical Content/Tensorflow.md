What exactly is TensorFlow?
Before we talk about TensorFlow, we will need to know what Deep Learning is. Deep Learning is a part of Machine Learning that focuses on algorithms that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. These algorithms are referred to as artificial neural networks. Neural networks learn to do things by considering examples, which is what we as humans do. Deep learning is behind a lot of the new cool technologies like driverless cars.
Deep learning models learn to perform tasks directly from images, text or sound and can sometimes exceed human-level performance. They are trained by incorporating large sets of data into neural networks.

This is a typical neural network. There is an input and outer layer and a bunch of hidden layers. Typically, there is only one hidden layer. If there is more than one, it is known as a deep neural network. The input layer accepts large amounts of data as input to build the network. It then passes that data to the hidden layer(s) where the data is processed by performing complex operations and feature extraction is carried out. The training occurs in the hidden layer(s). It is then passed to the outer layer which translates it into output format.
TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google and has become very popular with Machine Learning. TensorFlow offers APIs that facilitates Machine Learning. TensorFlow also has a faster compilation time than other Deep Learning libraries such as Keras and Touch. TensorFlow supports both CPU and GPU computing devices.
It was originally developed to run large numerical computations which makes it a great tool for Deep Learning. It accepts data in the form of multidimensional arrays called Tensors. This application lends itself to handling large amounts of data. The execution mechanism is in the form of graphs so that makes it easier to execute the code.
Once you have accessed the data in TensorFlow, there is a computation that needs to be done. Each computation in TensorFlow is represented as a Data Flow Graph. It is not like traditional programming. We prepare graphs with nodes and then they are executed in the form of a session with the data in the Tensors. Each node in the graph represents a mathematical operation (add, subtract, multiply, etc.) and each edge represents multidimensional arrays which are the Tensors. The graph is then executed and the data is processed.
It takes a long time to train the models in deep learning because of the large amount of data and using TensorFlow makes it easier to write the code and then execute it in a distributed manner.
It’s an exciting time for Machine Learning and I’m excited to learn more about how I can use Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
